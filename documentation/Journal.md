# Journal

A Journal is associated with a [Publication](Publication.md). In some cases, the Journal may be important for determining whether the [User](User.md) needs to manually create a [Submission](Submission.md) through PASS or whether the [Publisher](Publisher.md) has a pre-existing arrangement with the target [Repository](Repository.md). Specifically, in the case of the National Institutes of Health Public Access Policy, many Journals already make arrangements to submit the author's accepted manuscript to PubMed Central directly.
