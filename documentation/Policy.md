# Policy

A Policy describes the access compliance requirements for a specific [Funder](Funder.md) or Institution. These Policies are used to determine which [Repositories](Repository.md) a [Publication](Publication.md) should be [submitted](Submission.md) to in order to be in compliance with its associated [Grants](Grant.md) and the User's institutional policies.

| Field  		| Type  		| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| __id*__ | URI | Unique Policy URI (autogenerated) |
| title* | String | Title of policy e.g. "NIH Public Access Policy" |
| description | String | Several sentence description of policy |
| policyUrl | URI | A link to the actual policy on the policy-owner's page |
| repositories* | List[URI] | List of URIs for [Repositories](Repository.md) that can satisfying this Policy |
| institution | URI | URI of the Institution whose Policy this is (note: if instution has a value, funder will be null). For the first version of PASS, there will be no actual Institution model, this will be added at a later date, so if there is an institution assigned, it will always be JHU |
| funder | URI | URI of the Funder whose Policy this is (note: if funder has a value, institution will be null)  |

*Properties automatically generated by the system are documented in [System Properties](SystemProperties.md). These are not available to client tools by default.*

_Note: this is basic at the moment. Eventually additional fields to help with application of policy logic could be added e.g. materialType to support data policies, some sense of whether the policy is required or can be overridden by complying with another policy etc._
