# Policy

A policy determines what rules should be followed by a [Submission](Submission.md).

| Field  		| Type  		| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| __id*__ | String | Unique Policy URI (autogenerated) |
| title* | String | Title of policy e.g. "NIH Public Access Policy" |
| description | String | Several sentence description of policy |
| repositories* | List[[Repository](Repository.md)] | List of repositories that can satisfying this policy |
| isDefault | Boolean | True if this policy should appear for all submission. This can be used to identify a policy or policies that should show up for everything  |
 
*required 

*Properties automatically generated by the system are documented in [System Properties](SystemProperties.md). These are not available to client tools by default.*

_Note: this is basic at the moment. Eventually additional fields to help with application of policy logic could be added e.g. materialType to support data policies, some sense of whether the policy is required or can be overridden by complying with another policy etc._
