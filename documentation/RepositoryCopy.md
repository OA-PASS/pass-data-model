# Repository Copy

A Repository Copy represents a copy of a [Publication](Publication.md) that exists in a target [Repository](Repository.md). The Repository Copy either (1) was the result of an accepted [Deposit](Deposit.md) from PASS, in which case there would be a link to the Copy from the related Deposit record, or (2) was created outside of PASS by some other process. In this second instance, the PASS system stores the information to help determine whether a Publication is already compliance.
