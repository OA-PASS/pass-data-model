# Submission
In order to comply with access [funder](Funder.md) and institutional access [policies](Policy.md), [Users](User.md) may be required to submit their [Publications](Publication.md) to one or more [Repositories](Repository.md). A Submission is associated with a single User and a single Publication. It encapsulates a User satisfying one or more Policies relevant to their Publication by either (1) [Deposits](Deposits.md) initiated in PASS or (2) [Copies](RepositoryCopy.md) of the publication that already exist in the target repositories. The User can start a Submission by describing their Publication and attaching relevant [Grants](Grant.md) to it. The PASS system will use this information to determine which policies apply, and will help the User send the Publication out to the Repositories that will fulfill them.   

Note that the source of a Submission record is not always a PASS User. In some instance, Submissions are created as a result of an import process designed to ensure that the User can see data relevant to their compliance with Policies in a uniform way.

| Field  		| Type  		| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| __id*__ | URI | Unique Submission URI (autogenerated) |
| metadata | String | Stringified JSON representation of metadata captured by the relevant repository forms. This will hold extended metadata relevant to the repositories selected in the Submission workflow. It may include fields such as embargoEndDate, embargoText, pmid, and anything else required by specific repositories etc. |
| source* | Enum ([_see list below_](#source-options)) | Indicates whether the record came from outside of PASS as an import, or was created through the system |
| submitted* | boolean | When true, this value signals that the Submission will no longer be edited by the User. It indicates to Deposit services that it can generate Deposits for any Repositories that need one. This becomes "true" when the User clicks "submit" in the UI. For Submissions generated by loader processes this value will be false when the User must complete the Submission, or true if it is merely pointing to an existing copy of the Publication in a Repository. |
| submittedDate | DateTime | Date the record was submitted by the [User](User.md) through PASS |
| aggregatedDepositStatus | Enum ([_see list below_](#aggregated-deposit-status-options)) | Status of submission derived from Deposit statuses. If there are no Deposit records, the value will be null |
| publication* | URI | URI of Publication represented in this Submission |
| repositories* | List[URI] | A list of URIs for the Repositories that the this Publication will exist in when the Submission is completed |
| user*  | URI | URI of the User responsible for managing the Submission. The User will be the individual who either created this Submission through PASS, thus claiming responsibility, or who has been assigned based on their being PI of an associated Grant |
| grants | List[URI] | List of URIs [Grants](Grant.md) that are associated with the User and are relevant to the Publication being submitted |
