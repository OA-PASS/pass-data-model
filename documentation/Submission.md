# Submission
This captures the details of a submission that can be managed through PASS. A submission holds information about a single publication that can be [deposited](Deposit.md) into one or more [respositories](Repository.md). For publications that are associated with one or more [Grants](Grant.md), each unique PI should have a separate submission in PASS for that publication, as each will need to comply with the [policies](Policy.md) of their specific [funder](Funder.md). This means that where there is more than one grant in a submission, they must all have the same PI.
